# GifTastic
This application uses the Giphy api to get the gifs that matches your key words you typed.  The user will enter in a country that begins with a C and will display 10 gifs that pertain to that country.

## Installing / Getting started

This application doesn't require any other installation for a user.

### Initial Configuration

Before starting development of this application, we needed to get an api key in order to use the Giphy api.


## Running the tests

The page says enter a country that starts with a C, but you can really enter anything and it will search it for your.
